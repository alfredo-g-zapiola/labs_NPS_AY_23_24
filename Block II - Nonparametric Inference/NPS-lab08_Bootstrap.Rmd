## Bootstrapping and Nonlinear Regression

For our laboratory on Boostrapping, knowing that you've already seen some interesting feats in class, I decided to focus on an area where the impact of non-parametric inferential techniques are really powerful: non-linear regression.

Let's start by loading and displaying some data, regarding the growth of some orange trees (specifically, the diameter of their trunk)

```{r}
data("Orange")
Orange
```

You see that we have a longitudinal dataset, with repeated measurements for 5 different trees. Let's select just one of them

```{r}
O_3 <- subset(Orange, Orange$Tree == 3)
attach(O_3)
# let's have a look at the data
plot(age, circumference, main = "Circumference of Tree #3",
  xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "Circumference")
```

The temporal evolution of the circumference seems to be relatively well described by a logistic curve... How can I estimate it?

```{r}
logistic <- function(t, L, k, midpoint) {
  L/(1 + exp((midpoint - t)/k))
}
```

Here $t$ is the independent variable, $L$ is the asymptote parameter, $k$ is the growth rate and $midpoint$ is the point in time when the derivative of the curve is at its maximum level (the peak, if you want an epidemic analogy).
How do I estimate the parameters $L, k,midpoint$ in such nonlinear relationship? I use `nls`.

```{r}
model <- nls(circumference ~ logistic(age, L, k, midpoint),
  start = list(L = 150, k = 500, midpoint = 700)  # initialise variables for optimisation
  )

summary(model)
```

Let's plot the estimated curve now: I need to start by generating my predictions on a fine grid

```{r}
age_fine <- seq(0, 2500)
circumference_fine <- predict(model, list(age = age_fine))
```

Then I plot my original points, and I overlay to them the predicted curve

```{r}
plot(age, circumference, main = "Fitted curve vs data",
  xlim = c(0, 2500), ylim = c(20, 200))
lines(age_fine, circumference_fine, col = "red")
```

What if I want to make inference about these parameters? Either I impose a parametric model on the error term, or, as you expect, I can use the boostrap.

Let's start then by computing the residuals:

```{r}
fitted.obs <- predict(model)
res.obs <- circumference - fitted.obs
```

And, let's start by computing confidence intervals for the asymptote parameter

```{r}
L.obs <- summary(model)$parameters[1, 1]
T.boot.L <- numeric(B)
formula.b <- response.b ~ logistic(age, L, k, midpoint)

pb <- progress_bar$new(
  format = "  processing [:bar] :percent eta: :eta",
  total = B,
  clear = FALSE)

set.seed(seed)

for (b in 1:B) {
  response.b <- fitted.obs + sample(res.obs, replace = T)
  fm.b <- nls(formula.b, start = list(L = 150, k = 500, midpoint = 700))
  sm.b <- summary(fm.b)
  T.boot.L[b] <- sm.b$parameters[1, 1]
  pb$tick()
}
```

let's now compare the bootstrap distribution of the parameter with the parameter itself...
```{r}
hist(T.boot.L, main='Asymptote Bootstrap p.m.f.')
abline(v=L.obs, lty=2)
```

```{r}
plot(ecdf(T.boot.L), main='Asymptote Bootstrap cdf')
abline(v=L.obs, lty=2)
```

Using the Bootstrap distribution of the parameter, I can compute without the need of distributional assumptions and/or approximations the standard deviation of the estimate of this parameter.

```{r}
sd(T.boot.L)
```

As well as its bias

```{r}
bias <- mean(T.boot.L) - L.obs

MSE <- var(T.boot.L) + (bias)^2

```

What if I want to compute a confidence interval around the parameter? I can use the classical reverse-percentile approach:

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
right.quantile.L <- quantile(T.boot.L, 1 - alpha/2)
left.quantile.L <- quantile(T.boot.L, alpha/2)

CI.RP.L <- c(L.obs - (right.quantile.L - L.obs),
             L.obs,
             L.obs - (left.quantile.L - L.obs))
names(CI.RP.L) <- c("lwr", "lvl", "upr")
CI.RP.L
```

And, let's visualize them

```{r}
plot(ecdf(T.boot.L), main = "L")
abline(v = L.obs, lty = 2)
abline(v = CI.RP.L)

plot(age, circumference, main = "Fitted curve vs data",
     xlim = c(0, 2500), ylim = c(20, 200))
lines(age_fine, circumference_fine, col = "red")
abline(h = L.obs, lty = 2)
abline(h = CI.RP.L)
```


#### ANOVA with the Bootstrap

You have already seen the Bootstrap linear regression in the lectures with Prof. Vantini. For the sake of completeness, let us use the  `chickwts` dataset.

```{r}
attach(chickwts)
g <- nlevels(feed)
n <- dim(chickwts)[1]


plot(feed, weight, xlab='treat',col=rainbow(g),main='Original Data')
```
The null hypothesis that we want to test is that, being
$\tau_i, i\in \{1,\ldots6\}$ the generic effect of a given level of the
treatment. 

$$
H_0: \tau_i=0\;\forall i\;vs\;H_1:\exists\,\tau_i\neq0 
$$
And we use the $F$ statistic for the global test:
```{r}
fit <- lm(weight ~ feed)
summary(fit)
T0 <- summary(fit)$fstatistic[1]  # extract the test statistic
T0

```
And now we estimate via M.C. the Bootstrap distribution of such statistic.
For that, remember we first need to estimate the model under $H_0$ to exchange the residuals. Since the model under $H_0$ is the empty model, whence:
```{r}
y.fitted <- mean(weight)
residuals.H0 <- weight - y.fitted
```



```{r}
T_stat <- numeric(B) 
n <- dim(chickwts)[1]

for(perm in 1:B){
  # Permutation:
  permutation <- sample(1:n, replace = T)
  residuals.perm <- residuals.H0[permutation]
  y.perm <- y.fitted + residuals.perm
  fit_perm <- lm(y.perm ~ feed)
  
  # Test statistic:
  T_stat[perm] <- summary(fit_perm)$fstatistic[1]
}
```

```{r}
hist(T_stat,xlim=range(c(T_stat,T0)),breaks=30,
     main="Bootstrap distribution of T0 under H_0")
abline(v=T0,col=3,lwd=2)
# p-value
p_val <- sum(T_stat>=T0)/B
p_val
```
